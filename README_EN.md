MIT License - Use freely in your projects

### MIT License Explained Simply

The MIT license is like a legal rule for sharing this program. Imagine you created an amazing toy and decided to share it with your friends. The MIT license is like saying:

- ✅ You can use my toy however you want
- ✅ You can modify my toy (add more pieces or change the colors)
- ✅ You can share the toy with other friends
- ✅ You can even use the toy to create a project for your school science fair

The only condition is that you keep the small card that says who originally created the toy. This is so everyone knows where the toy came from, even after many people have played with it!

And best of all: if something breaks while you're playing with it, it's not the creator's fault! Everyone is responsible for how they use it.
